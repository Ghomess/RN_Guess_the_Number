# Guess your Number

Guess your Number is a mobile app built with React Native. The app prompts the
user to think of a number between 1 and 100 and then tries to guess it by
suggesting numbers. The user can indicate whether the suggested number is higher
or lower than the selected number, and the app will try to guess again.
